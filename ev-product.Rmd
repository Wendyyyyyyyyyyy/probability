# Expected Value of a Product {#ev-product}


## Theory {-}


```{theorem ev-product, name="Expected Value of a Product"}
If $X$ and $Y$ are _independent_ random variables, then 
\begin{equation}
E[XY] = E[X] E[Y].
(\#eq:ev-product)
\end{equation}
In fact, if $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then for any functions $g$ and $h$,
\begin{equation}
E[g(X)h(Y)] = E[g(X)] E[h(Y)].
(\#eq:ev-product-general)
\end{equation}
```

## Essential Practice {-}


1. Consider the following three scenarios:

    - A fair coin is tossed 3 times. $X$ is the number of heads and $Y$ is the number of tails.
    - A fair coin is tossed 4 times. $X$ is the number of heads in the first 3 tosses, $Y$ is the number of heads in the last 3 tosses.
    - A fair coin is tossed 6 times. $X$ is the number of heads in the first 3 tosses, $Y$ is the number of heads in the last 3 tosses.
    
    In Lesson \@ref(lotus2d), you showed that $E[X + Y]$ was the same for all three scenarios, but 
    $E[XY]$ was different. In light of Theorems \@ref(thm:linearity) and \@ref(thm:ev-product), explain why 
    this makes sense.
    
2. Two fair dice are rolled. Let $X$ be the outcome of the first die. Let $Y$ be the outcome of the 
second die. Calculate the expected ratio between the outcomes of the two dice, $\displaystyle E[X / Y]$.
(You can use Theorem \@ref(thm:ev-product), since $X$ and $Y$ are independent. However, 
be careful because $E[X / Y] \neq E[X] / E[Y]$.) 

3. At Diablo Canyon nuclear plant, radioactive particles hit a Geiger counter according to a Poisson process 
with a rate of 3.5 particles per second. Let $X$ be the number of particles detected in the first 2 seconds. 
Let $Y$ be the number of particles detected in the second after that (i.e., the 3rd second). Find $E[XY]$.

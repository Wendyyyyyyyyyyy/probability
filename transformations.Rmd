## Motivating Example {-}

You buy fencing for a square enclosure. The length of fencing that you buy is uniformly distributed between 
0 and 4 meters. What is the distribution of the *area* of the enclosure?

Most people realize that the area must be between 0 and 1 square meters, 
since the length of each side must be between 0 and 1 meters, and 
the square of a number between 0 and 1 is also between 0 and 1. But how likely 
are the values in between?

## Theory {-}

We can formalize the above example as follows. The length of fencing, $L$, is a 
$\text{Uniform}(a=0, b=4)$ random variable, and we are interested in the 
distribution of $A = (L/4)^2$.

First, let's simulate the distribution of $A$. The Colab below begins with a 
uniform random variable $L$, defines $A = (L / 4)^2$, and displays 10000 simulations of 
both $L$ and $A$.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/dlsun/952e02f66b471c7f368c74755b05b8a3.js"></script>

In the simulation above, $L$ is equally likely to take on
all values between 0 and 4. This is not surprising because $L$ was defined to be this way 
(a uniform distribution between 0 and 4). 
The distribution of $A$ is more interesting. It is much 
more concentrated toward the lower values than the higher values. In hindsight, 
this makes sense because $(L / 4)$ is a number between 0 and 1, and numbers between 0 
and 1 get smaller when we square them.

How do we derive the p.d.f. of $A$? This is a special case of a more general problem. 
We have a random variable $X$ whose distribution we know, and we want to find the distribution of 
$Y = g(X)$, a transformation of $X$. The strategy for these problems is this:

1. Calculate the c.d.f. of $Y$ (by rewriting the event in terms of $X$ and using the known distribution of $X$).
2. Take the derivative to obtain the p.d.f. of $Y$ (by Definition \@ref(def:pdf)).

```{example}
Let's apply this strategy to the example at the beginning of the lesson.

First, we find the c.d.f. of $A$, the area of the enclosure. We write out the definition 
of the c.d.f., express $A$ in terms of $L$, and rearrange the expression to make 
the probability easy to calculate.
\begin{align*}
F_A(x) &= P(A \leq x) \\
&= P\left((L/4)^2 \leq x\right) \\
&= P(L \leq 4 \sqrt{x}) & \text{(if $x \geq 0$)} \\
&= \begin{cases} 0 & x < 0 \\ \sqrt{x} & 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\ 1 & x > 1 \end{cases}.
\end{align*}

Now we take the derivative to get the p.d.f.
\[ f_A(x) = \frac{d}{dx} F_A(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}} & 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}. \]

We graph the p.d.f.s of $L$ and $A$ below. Compare these with our simulations above.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.show = "hold", fig.align = "center",fig.cap="Distributions of $L$ and $A$", fig.asp=0.6}
par(mgp=c(1, 1, 0))

t <- seq(0, 4, by=0.1)
plot(t, rep(1/4, length(t)), type="l", lwd=3, col="blue", 
     xaxt="n", yaxt="n", bty="n",
     xlab="x", ylab="Probability Density Function f(x)", 
     xlim=c(-0.5, 4.5), ylim=c(-0.05, 2.1))
axis(1, pos=0)
axis(2, pos=0)
lines(c(-0.5, 0), c(0, 0), lwd=3, col="blue")
lines(c(4, 4.5), c(0, 0), lwd=3, col="blue")

t <- seq(0.01, 1, by=0.01)
lines(t, 1 / (2 * sqrt(t)), lwd=2, col="orange")
axis(1, pos=0)
axis(2, pos=0)
lines(c(-0.5, 0), c(0, 0), lwd=2, col="orange")
lines(c(1, 4.5), c(0, 0), lwd=2, col="orange")

legend(3.8, 2, c("L", "A"),
       lwd=c(3, 2), col=c("blue", "orange"))
```

Now, we derive formulas for the two most common types of transformations: 
shifting by a constant and scaling by a constant.

```{theorem shift-transform, name="Shift Transformation"}
Let $X$ be a continuous random variable with p.d.f. $f_X$.
The p.d.f. of $Y = X + b$ is 
\begin{equation}
f_Y(y) = f_X(y - b). 
(\#eq:shift-transform)
\end{equation}
```{proof}
We can express the c.d.f. of $Y$ in terms of the c.d.f. of $X$:
\begin{align*}
F_Y(y) &= P(Y \leq y) \\
&= P(X + b \leq y) \\
&= P(X \leq y - b) \\
&= F_X(y - b).
\end{align*}

Taking the derivative, we see that the p.d.f. is 
\[ f_Y(y) = \frac{d}{dy} F_Y(y) = f_X(y - b). \]

The figure below illustrates a hypothetical p.d.f. for a random variable $X$ and the 
corresponding p.d.f. for the shifted random variable $Y = X + 1$. Notice how the p.d.f. 
is exactly the same, except shifted to the right by 1, as we would expect.
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.show = "hold", fig.align = "center",fig.cap="Example of a Shift Transformation", fig.asp=0.6}
par(mgp=c(1, 1, 0))

t <- seq(-1, 1, by=0.1)
plot(t, 1 - abs(t), type="l", lwd=3,
     xaxt="n", yaxt="n", bty="n",
     xlab="x", ylab="Probability Density Function f(x)", 
     xlim=c(-2.5, 2.5), ylim=c(-0.05, 1.1))
axis(1, pos=0)
lines(c(-2.5, -1), c(0, 0), lwd=3)
lines(c(1, 2.5), c(0, 0), lwd=3)

t <- seq(0, 2, by=0.1)
lines(t, 1 - abs(t - 1), lwd=2, col="blue")
axis(1, pos=0)
lines(c(-2.5, 0), c(0, 0), lwd=2, col="blue")
lines(c(2, 2.5), c(0, 0), lwd=2, col="blue")

legend(-2.5, 1.1, c(expression(f[X]), expression(f[Y])),
       lwd=c(3, 2), col=c("black", "blue"))
```


```{theorem scale-transform, name="Scale Transformation"}
Let $X$ be a continuous random variable with p.d.f. $f_X$.
The p.d.f. of $Y = aX$, where $a > 0$ is a constant, is 
\begin{equation} 
f_Y(y) = \frac{1}{a} f_X(\frac{y}{a}).
(\#eq:scale-transform)
\end{equation}
```{proof}
We can express the c.d.f. of $Y$ in terms of the c.d.f. of $X$:
\begin{align*}
F_Y(y) &= P(Y \leq y) \\
&= P(aX \leq y) \\
&= P(X \leq \frac{y}{a}) \\
&= F_X(\frac{y}{a}).
\end{align*}

Taking the derivative (don't forget the chain rule!), we see that the p.d.f. is 
\[ f_Y(y) = \frac{d}{dy} F_Y(y) = \frac{1}{a} f_X(\frac{y}{a}). \]

The figure below illustrates a hypothetical p.d.f. for a random variable $X$ and the 
corresponding p.d.f. for the scaled random variable $Y = 2X$. Notice that the p.d.f. 
is the same shape, just wider and shorter.
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.show = "hold", fig.align = "center",fig.cap="Example of a Scale Transformation", fig.asp=0.6}
par(mgp=c(1, 1, 0))

t <- seq(-1, 1, by=0.1)
plot(t, 1 - abs(t), type="l", lwd=3,
     xaxt="n", yaxt="n", bty="n",
     xlab="x", ylab="Probability Density Function f(x)", 
     xlim=c(-2.5, 2.5), ylim=c(-0.05, 1.1))
axis(1, pos=0)
lines(c(-2.5, -1), c(0, 0), lwd=3)
lines(c(1, 2.5), c(0, 0), lwd=3)

t <- seq(-2, 2, by=0.1)
lines(t, (1 - abs(t / 2)) / 2, lwd=2, col="red")
axis(1, pos=0)
lines(c(-2.5, -2), c(0, 0), lwd=2, col="red")
lines(c(2, 2.5), c(0, 0), lwd=2, col="red")

legend(-2.5, 1.1, c(expression(f[X]), expression(f[Y])),
       lwd=c(3, 2), col=c("black", "red"))
```
The factor of $\frac{1}{a}$ on the inside in 
\@ref(eq:scale-transform) is what makes the p.d.f. wider, and the factor of $\frac{1}{a}$ on the 
outside is what makes it shorter. It is necessary to make the p.d.f. shorter if we make it 
wider, since the total area under a p.d.f. must always be 1.



## Essential Practice {-}

1. You inflate a spherical balloon in a single breath. If the volume of air you exhale in a 
single breath (in cubic inches) is $\text{Uniform}(a=36\pi, b=288\pi)$ random variable, what 
is the p.d.f. of the radius of the balloon (in inches)?

2. The lifetime of a lightbulb (in hours) follows an 
$\text{Exponential}(\lambda=\frac{1}{1200})$ distribution. 
Find the p.d.f. of the lifetime of the lightbulb in _days_ 
(assuming the lightbulb is on 24 hours per day).

3. A lighthouse on a shore is shining light toward the ocean at a 
random angle $U$ (measured in radians), where $U$ follows a 
$\text{Uniform}(a=-\frac{\pi}{2}, b=\frac{\pi}{2})$ distribution.

    Consider a line which is parallel to the shore and 1 mile away from the 
shore, as illustrated below. An angle of 0 would mean the ray of 
light is perpendicular to the shore, while an angle of $\pi/2$ 
would mean the ray is along the shore, shining to the right 
from the perspective of the figure. 

    ![](https://github.com/dlsun/probability/blob/master/docs/bookdown-demo_files/figure-html/lighthouse.png?raw=true)

    Let $X$ be the point that the light hits on the line, where the 
    line's origin is the point on the line that is closest to the 
    lighthouse. Find the p.d.f. of $X$.

    (_Hint:_ Use trigonometry to write $X$ as a function of $U$.)

## Additional Practice {-}

1. The radius of a circle (in inches) is chosen from an 
$\text{Exponential}(\lambda=1.5)$ distribution. Find the 
p.d.f. of the _area_ of the circle.

Theory Definition 1.1 (Definition of Probability) If all possible outcomes are equally likely, then the probability of an event \\(A\\) is \\[ P(A) = \\frac{\\text{number of outcomes where $A$ occurs}}{\\text{number of possible outcomes}}. \\] For example, suppose we want to know the probability of getting an even number when we roll a fair die. There are \\(6\\) equally likely possible outcomes, ⚀ ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ ⚅, of which 3 are even. Therefore, the probability of rolling an even number is \\[ P(\\text{even number}) = \\frac{\\text{number of outcomes that are even}}{\\text{number of possible outcomes}} = \\frac{3}{6}. \\] Next, suppose we want to know the probability of rolling a 7 when we roll two fair dice. There are 36 equally likely outcomes, ⚀⚀ ⚁⚀ ⚂⚀ ⚃⚀ ⚄⚀ ⚅⚀ ⚀⚁ ⚁⚁ ⚂⚁ ⚃⚁ ⚄⚁ ⚅⚁ ⚀⚂ ⚁⚂ ⚂⚂ ⚃⚂ ⚄⚂ ⚅⚂ ⚀⚃ ⚁⚃ ⚂⚃ ⚃⚃ ⚄⚃ ⚅⚃ ⚀⚄ ⚁⚄ ⚂⚄ ⚃⚄ ⚄⚄ ⚅⚄ ⚀⚅ ⚁⚅ ⚂⚅ ⚃⚅ ⚄⚅ ⚅⚅ of which 6 outcomes add up to 7. (Check this for yourself!) Therefore, the probability of rolling a 7 is \\[ P(\\text{sum is 7}) = \\frac{\\text{number of outcomes where the sum is 7}}{\\text{number of possible outcomes}} = \\frac{6}{36}. \\] Galileo needed to consider the possible outcomes when three dice are rolled. At this point, listing all of the possible outcomes is impractical. We need to find a way to count the number of outcomes without listing all of them. Here is a way to see that there are 36 ways to roll two dice, without listing them out. There are 6 possible outcomes for the first die, and each of these 6 outcomes can be paired with 6 possible outcomes for the second die. Therefore, there must be \\(6 \\cdot 6 = 36\\) ways to roll two dice. The following theorem generalizes this principle. Theorem 1.1 (Multiplication Principle of Counting) If a task can be performed in \\(n_1\\) ways, and for each of these ways, a second task can be performed in \\(n_2\\) ways, then the two tasks can be performed together in a total of \\(n_1 \\cdot n_2\\) ways. Proof. List the outcomes in a table, with \\(n_1\\) columns and \\(n_2\\) rows (like we did above for the possible outcomes of two dice, where \\(n_1 = n_2 = 6\\)). Each column corresponds to one of the \\(n_1\\) possible outcomes of the first task, each row to one of the \\(n_2\\) possible outcomes of the second. There are \\(n_1 \\cdot n_2\\) cells in the table. Using the multiplication principle, we can count the total number of ways of rolling three dice. We already know that there are 36 ways that the first two dice can come out. Each of these 36 ways can be matched with each of the 6 ways that the third dice can come out. Therefore, by Theorem @ref{thm:multiplication-principle}, there are \\[ 36 \\cdot 6 = 216 \\] ways the three dice could come out. Using the multiplication principle, we can calculate the probability that no sixes are rolled among the three dice. In order for there to be no sixes, each of the three dice must have shown one of the other 5 numbers. The number of ways for this to happen is \\[ 5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 = 125, \\] so the probability is \\[ P(\\text{no sixes}) = \\frac{125}{216} \\approx 57.8\\%. \\] Now, Galileo was interested in the event that the numbers add up to 9, which is much trickier to count. We will come back to his question in a future lesson, once we have more counting tools under our belt. Examples In the casino game craps, two dice are rolled by a player, called the “shooter”. The first roll is called the “come-out roll”. The shooter wins on the come-out roll if they roll a 7 or a 11. On the other hand, they lose if the come-out roll is a 2, 3, or 12. Otherwise, the game continues. What is the probability that the shooter wins on the come-out roll? What is the probability that the shooter loses on the come-out roll? What is the probability that the game continues? If you add up the three probabilities you just calculated, what do you get? Why does this make sense? Many examples in this book will be based on a standard deck of 52 playing cards, consisting of 13 cards of each suit. Familiarize yourself with the terminology. Suppose you draw one card from a shuffled deck of cards. What is the probability that the card is a heart? What is the probability that the card is an ace? What is the probability that the card is a face card (also known as a “court card”)? Many examples in this book will be based on the casino game roulette. Familiarize yourself with the roulette wheel. (Click the wheel to spin it.) You win if the ball lands in a pocket that matches your bet. What is the probability that you win if you bet on red? What is the probability that you win if you bet on the number 10? What is the probability that you win if you bet on odd (i.e., that the number is odd)? In standard poker, each player is dealt 5 cards off the top of a (shuffled) deck of cards. The hand is called a “flush” if all 5 cards are the same suit. What is the probability that you get a flush of hearts (i.e., all 5 cards are hearts)? Additional Exercises "],
["factorial.html", "Lesson 2 The Factorial Motivating Example Theory Examples Additional Exercises", " Lesson 2 The Factorial Motivating Example How many ways are there to arrange a deck of 52 cards? Theory We can use the multiplication rule to determine the number of ways to arrange the deck. The first card can be any one of 52 cards. No matter which one it is, the second card can be any one of the remaining 51 cards. So there are \\(52 \\cdot 51\\) ways to choose the first 2 cards. For every one of these \\(52 \\cdot 51\\) ways, there are \\(50\\) remaining cards to choose as the third card, which makes \\(52 \\cdot 51 \\cdot 50\\) ways to choose the first 3 cards. And so on. By the time we get to the last card in the deck, there is only \\(1\\) card left. So there are \\[ 52 \\cdot 51 \\cdot 50 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\] ways to arrange the 52 cards in a deck. This is such an important quantity in probability and counting that it has been given a special name. Definition 2.1 (Factorial) The quantity \\(n!\\) (pronounced: “n factorial”) is defined as \\[ n! = n \\cdot (n-1) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 1. \\] It represents the number of ways to arrange \\(n\\) objects. So the number of ways to arrange a deck of cards can be expressed as \\(52!\\). Using Wolfram Alpha, we can calculate this to be about \\(8 \\times 10^{67}\\), an astronomical number. In particular, it is greater than: the number of seconds since the universe began. the number of atoms on Earth. So the next time you hold a shuffled deck of cards in your hands, spend a moment appreciating the fact that you are holding an arrangement that has likely never before existed in the history of the universe. Examples Each year, as part of a “Secret Santa” tradition, a group of 4 friends write their names on slips of papers and place the slips into a hat. Each member of the group draws a name at random from the hat and must by a gift for that person. Of course, it is possible that they draw their own name, in which case they buy a gift for themselves. What is the probability that everyone in the group ends up buying a gift for themselves? (Note that the names are not placed back in the hat once they are drawn, so each person receives exactly one gift.) A deck of 52 cards is shuffled thoroughly. What is the probability that the four aces are all next to each other? (Hint: First, count the number of positions that the block of four aces can go, then multiply this by the number of ways of ordering the four aces.) If a five-letter word is formed at random (meaning that all sequences of five letters are equally likely), what is the probability that no letter occurs more than once? The “bootstrap” is a statistical method for generating a new data set that is like an existing one. Suppose we have a data set consisting of \\(6\\) observations: \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6\\). To generate a “bootstrap” data set, we sample from the original data set with replacement, meaning that it is possible for each observation to be sampled more than once. Examples of bootstrap data sets include: \\[\\begin{align*} x_4, x_2, x_4, x_3, x_2, x_4 \\\\ x_3, x_1, x_6, x_1, x_1, x_2 \\\\ x_2, x_1, x_4, x_3, x_6, x_5 \\end{align*}\\] Notice that in the last example, each observation appears exactly once. What is the probability that the bootstrap data set contains each observation exactly once? Additional Exercises "],
["box-models.html", "Lesson 3 Box Models and Combinations Motivating Example Theory Examples", " Lesson 3 Box Models and Combinations Motivating Example One of the most coveted hands in poker is a four-of-a-kind, which is when the hand contains all four cards of a particular rank. For example, the hand below is an example of a four-of-a-kind, since it contains all four 7s in the deck. (The last card, called the “kicker”, can be any other card.) In this lesson, we will calculate the probability of a four-of-a-kind in two ways: (1) using methods that we have already learned and (2) using combinations, which is a new method that will be introduced in this lesson. Theory Many counting and probability problems can be reduced to a box model. In a box model, there are \\(N\\) tickets in a box, and we draw \\(n\\) tickets from the box. For example, three rolls of a fair die can be modeled as \\(n=3\\) draws from the box \\[ \\fbox{$\\fbox{1}\\ \\fbox{2}\\ \\fbox{3}\\ \\fbox{4}\\ \\fbox{5}\\ \\fbox{6}$}. \\] In order to accurately model how dice behave (i.e., the outcome of one die roll does not affect the outcome of another), we have to place the ticket back in the box after each draw. In other words, the \\(n=3\\) draws are made with replacement. In other situations, the draws are made without replacement. For example, consider four friends who draw names from a hat to determine whom each person’s Secret Santa is. If we call the four friends “1”, “2”, “3”, and “4” (their actual names are unimportant, as far as probability is concerned), then we can model the Secret Santa game as \\(n=4\\) draws from the box \\[ \\fbox{$\\fbox{1}\\ \\fbox{2}\\ \\fbox{3}\\ \\fbox{4}$}. \\] Since every person has exactly one Secret Santa, the draws must be made without replacement. Once a Secret Santa has been chosen for person 3, we remove \\(\\fbox{3}\\) from the box so that they do not end up with two Secret Santas. Using the multiplication principle (Theorem 1.1), we can count the number of ways to draw \\(n\\) tickets from the box \\[ \\fbox{$\\fbox{1}\\ \\fbox{2}\\ \\ldots\\ \\fbox{\\(N\\)}$}. \\] If drawing with replacement, the number of possible ways is \\[ \\underbrace{N \\cdot N \\cdot N \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot N}_{\\text{$n$ terms}} = N^n, \\] since we have \\(N\\) tickets to choose from on each draw. If drawing without replacement, the number of possible ways is \\[ \\underbrace{N \\cdot (N-1) \\cdot (N-2) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (N-n+1)}_{\\text{$n$ terms}} = \\frac{N!}{(N-n)!}, \\] since the number of tickets remaining in the box decreases by 1 on each draw. For example, if we assign a number 1 to 52 to each card in a standard playing deck, then a poker hand can be modeled as \\(n=5\\) draws, without replacement, from the box \\[ \\fbox{$\\fbox{1}\\ \\fbox{2}\\ \\ldots\\ \\fbox{52}$}. \\] The number of possible poker hands is \\[ \\frac{52!}{(52-5)!} = 52 \\cdot 51 \\cdot 50 \\cdot 49 \\cdot 48 = 311,875,200. \\] How many of these possible outcomes result in a four-of-a-kind? Here is the reasoning: Let’s start by assuming that the first four cards in the hand are the four-of-a-kind and the last card is the kicker. The first card can be any one of the 52 cards. Once we have chosen the first card, the rank of the four-of-a-kind is determined. The second card must be one of the 3 remaining cards of the same rank. The third card must be one of the 2 remaining cards of that rank. The fourth card must be the 1 remaining card of that rank. The last card, the kicker, is one of the other 48 cards in the deck. We assumed that the kicker was the last card in the hand. But the kicker could just as well have been the first card in the hand. In fact, the kicker could have been in any one of 5 positions. So we need to multiply everything by 5 in the end. So the probability of a four-of-a-kind is \\[ \\frac{(52 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 48) \\cdot 5}{52 \\cdot 51 \\cdot 50 \\cdot 49 \\cdot 48} \\approx .00024. \\] This calculation was complicated because we had to consider the different orders in which the cards might be drawn. It is often easier to ignore the order when counting outcomes. That is, we treat \\(\\fbox{1}\\ \\fbox{3}\\ \\fbox{4}\\ \\fbox{5}\\ \\fbox{8}\\) as the same outcome as \\(\\fbox{3}\\ \\fbox{5}\\ \\fbox{4}\\ \\fbox{1}\\ \\fbox{8}\\); we do not double count different reorderings of the same draws. Fortunately, when the draws are made without replacement, the unordered outcomes are also equally likely, so it is equally valid to count unordered outcomes as ordered ones for the purposes of calculating probabilities. If we ignore order when counting, we say that “order doesn’t matter”. Theorem 3.1 (Combinations) The number of ways to draw \\(n\\) tickets from the box \\[ \\fbox{$\\fbox{1}\\ \\fbox{2}\\ \\ldots\\ \\fbox{\\(N\\)}$}, \\] when order doesn’t matter, is symbolized \\(\\binom{N}{n}\\) (pronounced: “\\(N\\) choose \\(n\\)”) and is equal to \\[ \\binom{N}{n} = \\frac{N!}{n! (N-n)!}. \\] Proof. We know that any set of \\(n\\) distinct objects can be reordered in \\(n!\\) ways. So when we count different reorderings of the same set of \\(n\\) tickets, we end up counting each set of distinct tickets \\(n!\\) times. By the multiplication principle (Theorem 1.1): \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(\\text{# ways when order matters}\\right) &amp;= \\left(\\text{# ways when order doesn&#39;t matter}\\right) \\cdot n!. \\end{align*}\\] But we already know the left-hand side of this equation, the number of ways to draw \\(n\\) tickets without replacement when order matters: it is \\(\\frac{N!}{(N-n)!}\\). Solving for the unknown in this equation, we end up with: \\[\\begin{align*} \\binom{N}{n} \\overset{\\text{def}}{=} \\left(\\text{# ways when order doesn&#39;t matter}\\right) &amp;= \\frac{\\left(\\text{# ways when order matters}\\right)}{n!} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{N!}{n! (N-n)!} \\end{align*}\\] Now, let’s revisit the probability of a four-of-a-kind using combinations. If we ignore the order of the cards in the hand, there are \\[ \\binom{52}{5} = 2,598,960. \\] possible poker hands. (Binomial coefficients can be calculated using Wolfram Alpha.) Notice how much smaller this number is than the 300+ million ordered poker hands. That is because when order matters, each distinct (unordered) poker hand gets counted \\(5! = 120\\) times, once for each possible way of reordering the 5 cards in the hand. How many “unordered” four-of-a-kind hands are there? Here is how to count them: There are 13 ranks (Ace through King). Any one of these ranks could be the rank for the four-of-a-kind. Once we have chosen the rank, that completely determines 4 of the 5 cards in the four-of-a-kind hand. There is only one way to include all 4 cards of a given rank, since we are no longer concerned with the order in which they are drawn or their position in the hand. So all that’s left is to choose the kicker, which can be any one of the remaining 48 cards. So when we ignore order, there are \\[ 13 \\cdot 48 = 624 \\] ways to get a four-of-a-kind. The probability is therefore \\[ \\frac{13 \\times 48}{\\binom{52}{5}} = \\frac{624}{2,598,960} \\approx .00024, \\] which matches the answer from before. Notice how much simpler \\(13 \\cdot 48\\) is, compared with the mental gymnastics needed to account for the order. Examples In Lesson 1, you calculated the probability of a “flush of hearts” in poker by counting the possible hands. There, you took order into account. Repeat the calculation by counting the possible hands where order does not matter. How many different 8-letter “words” can be formed by rearranging the letters in LALALAAA? (Hint: Model this situation using \\(n=3\\) draws from the box \\(\\fbox{\\(\\fbox{1}\\ \\fbox{2}\\ \\ldots\\ \\fbox{8}\\)}\\). The tickets that you draw correspond to the positions of the three Ls. So, for example, drawing \\(\\fbox{3}, \\fbox{1}, \\fbox{5}\\) corresponds to the word LALALAAA. You still need to figure out whether the draws should be made with replacement and whether you should count different orderings of the same 3 tickets.) You toss a coin 60 times. Each toss results in two equally likely outcomes, heads or tails. What is the probability that you get exactly 30 heads in the 60 tosses? (Hint: To count the number of ways of getting exactly 30 heads, you need to count the number of ways of arranging 30 H and 30 Ts. The general strategy from the previous question may be helpful here.)

["replacement.html", "Lesson 4 Sampling With Replacement Motivating Example Discussion Examples Bonus Material", " Lesson 4 Sampling With Replacement Motivating Example Recall Galileo’s problem from Lesson 1. He wanted to know whether a sum of 9 or a sum of 10 was more likely when 3 dice are rolled. In fact, Galileo’s peers reasoned that the two events should be equally likely, since there are six ways to get a sum of 9 \\[\\begin{align*} 3 + 3 + 3 &amp; &amp; 2 + 3 + 4 &amp; &amp; 2 + 2 + 5 &amp; &amp; 1 + 4 + 4 &amp; &amp; 1 + 3 + 5 &amp; &amp; 1 + 2 + 6 \\end{align*}\\] and also six ways to get a sum of 10: \\[\\begin{align*} 3 + 3 + 4 &amp; &amp; 2 + 4 + 4 &amp; &amp; 2 + 3 + 5 &amp; &amp; 2 + 2 + 6 &amp; &amp; 1 + 4 + 5 &amp; &amp; 1 + 3 + 6 \\end{align*}\\] But gamblers of the day knew better. From experience, they knew that a sum of 10 was more likely than a sum of 9. But where did Galileo’s peers go wrong in their reasoning? Discussion Recall from Lesson 3 that the three rolls of a die can be modeled as \\(n=3\\) draws with replacement from the box \\[ \\fbox{$\\fbox{1}\\ \\fbox{2}\\ \\fbox{3}\\ \\fbox{4}\\ \\fbox{5}\\ \\fbox{6}$}. \\] Galileo’s peers showed that there are 6 ways to get a sum of 9 if you ignore the order in which the tickets were drawn. (Notice that they included 2 + 3 + 5, but not 3 + 5 + 2 and other orderings of the same three rolls.) They also showed that there are 6 ways to get a sum of 10. Why does this not guarantee the probabilities of the two events are the same? Notice that this case (draws with replacement, order doesn’t matter) is one that we have not studied yet. with replacement without replacement order matters \\(N^n\\) \\(\\frac{N!}{(N-n)!}\\) order doesn’t matter ??? \\(\\binom{N}{n} = \\frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}\\) To settle the question, let’s go back to counting ordered outcomes. The outcome \\(2 + 3 + 4\\) corresponds to \\(3! = 6\\) outcomes, when you account for the possible orderings: \\(2 + 3 + 4\\) \\(2 + 4 + 3\\) \\(3 + 2 + 4\\) \\(3 + 4 + 2\\) \\(4 + 2 + 3\\) \\(4 + 3 + 2\\) On the other hand, the outcome \\(2 + 2 + 5\\) can only be reordered \\(3\\) different ways: \\(2 + 2 + 5\\) \\(2 + 5 + 2\\) \\(5 + 2 + 2\\) And the outcome \\(3 + 3 + 3\\) only has one possible ordering. In other words, when we draw with replacement, the same ticket can be drawn more than once, and repetitions reduce the number of ways that tickets can be reordered. The problem with simply counting the number of outcomes is that the 6 outcomes \\[\\begin{align*} 3 + 3 + 3 &amp; &amp; 2 + 3 + 4 &amp; &amp; 2 + 2 + 5 &amp; &amp; 1 + 4 + 4 &amp; &amp; 1 + 3 + 5 &amp; &amp; 1 + 2 + 6 \\end{align*}\\] are not all equally likely. \\(2 + 3 + 4\\) is twice as likely as \\(2 + 2 + 5\\) and six times as likely as \\(3 + 3 + 3\\). When draws are made with replacement, only ordered outcomes are equally likely. This was Galileo’s insight. When he took into account the number of possible orderings associated with each unordered outcome: \\[\\begin{array}{rr} \\hline \\text{Unordered Outcome} &amp; \\text{Possible Orderings} \\\\ \\hline 3 + 3 + 3 &amp; \\text{1 way}\\ \\\\ 2 + 3 + 4 &amp; \\text{6 ways} \\\\ 2 + 2 + 5 &amp; \\text{3 ways} \\\\ 1 + 4 + 4 &amp; \\text{3 ways} \\\\ 1 + 3 + 5 &amp; \\text{6 ways} \\\\ 1 + 2 + 6 &amp; + \\text{6 ways} \\\\ \\hline &amp; \\text{25 ways} \\end{array}\\] he found that the probability of a 9 was actually \\[ \\frac{25}{216}. \\] (Remember that there are \\(6^3 = 216\\) equally likely outcomes when order matters.) Repeating the calculation for the probability of a 10, Galileo showed that the two probabilities were indeed different. Examples Here’s a different illustration of the fact that not all unordered outcomes are equally likely when draws are made with replacement. In the Pick 3 Lotto, a winning number is chosen between 000 to 999. Contestants win if the digits in their chosen number matches the winning number, in any order. What is your chance of winning if you bet on 053? What is your chance of winning if you bet on 055? What is your chance of winning if you bet on 555? Complete the solution to Galileo’s problem. What is the probability that the sum is 10 when 3 fair dice are rolled? How does this compare with the probability that the sum is 9?

["double-counting.html", "Lesson 5 Double Counting Motivating Example Theory Examples", " Lesson 5 Double Counting Motivating Example The French nobleman (and avid gambler) Chevalier de Méré knew that betting on at least one six (⚅) in 4 rolls of a die was a favorable bet for him. Once other gamblers caught on, he devised a new bet: at least one double-six (⚅⚅) in 24 rolls of two dice. Although he did not know how to calculate the probabilities, he reasoned that the two bets should be equivalent, since double-sixes are \\(1/6\\) as likely as a single six, but there are \\(6\\) times as many rolls to compensate Are the two bets equivalent? Theory Here is a common (but wrong) way of calculating the probability of getting at least one six in 4 rolls of a die. \\[\\begin{align*} P(\\text{at least one ⚅}) &amp;= P(\\text{⚅ on 1st roll, or ⚅ on 2nd roll, or ⚅ on 3rd roll or ⚅ on 4th roll}) \\\\ &amp;= P(\\text{⚅ on 1st roll}) + P(\\text{⚅ on 2nd roll}) + P(\\text{⚅ on 3nd roll}) + P(\\text{⚅ on 4th roll}) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{4}{6} ? \\end{align*}\\] What’s wrong with the above reasoning? The problem is that \\[ P(A \\text{ or } B) \\neq P(A) + P(B) \\] in general. The reason is that \\(P(A) + P(B)\\) double counts outcomes where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) both happen. For example, suppose \\(A\\) is “⚅ on 1st roll” and \\(B\\) is “⚅ on 2nd roll”. Then, it is not hard to see that the event \\(A \\text{ or } B\\) happens on 11 out of 36 outcomes, so \\[ P(A \\text{ or } B) = \\frac{11}{36} \\neq \\frac{12}{36} = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = P(A) + P(B). \\] \\(P(A) + P(B)\\) double counts the outcome where both rolls were ⚅s.

Theorem 5.1 (Inclusion-Exclusion Principle) \\[ P(A \\text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\text{ and } B) \\] Figure 5.2: Intuition for the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle So, for example: \\[\\begin{align*} P(\\text{at least one ⚅ in 2 rolls}) &amp;= P(\\text{⚅ on 1st roll}) + P(\\text{⚅ on 2nd roll}) - (P(\\text{⚅ on both rolls}) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{36} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{11}{36} \\end{align*}\\] However, this approach does not scale well to calculating the probability of at least one ⚅ in 4 rolls. In many situations, it is easier to calculate the probability that an event does not happen, also known as the complement of the event. Because the total probability has to be 1, the two probabilities are related by the following formula. Theorem 5.2 (Complement Rule) \\[ P(\\text{not } A) = 1 - P(A). \\] Let’s apply the Complement Rule to the Chevalier de Méré’s problem. To calculate the probability of getting at least one ⚅ in 4 rolls, we can calculate the probability of the complement. If we did not get at least one ⚅, that must mean that we got no ⚅s. This means that every roll was one of the other 5 outcomes. This probability is much easier to calculate using the counting tricks we have learned. \\[\\begin{align*} P(\\text{at least one ⚅}) &amp;= 1 - P(\\text{no ⚅s}) \\\\ &amp;= 1 - \\frac{5^4}{6^4} \\\\ &amp;\\approx 0.5177. \\end{align*}\\] Examples In poker, a “two pair” hand has 2 cards of one rank, 2 cards of another rank, and 1 card of a third rank. For example, the hand 2, 2, Q, Q, J is a “two pair”. Your friend calculates the probability of “two pair” as follows: There are \\(\\binom{52}{5}\\) equally likely hands (where order does not matter). We count the number of ways to choose the first pair. There are \\(13\\) choices for the rank and \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) choices for the two cards within the rank, so there are \\(13 \\times \\binom{4}{2}\\) ways. Next, we count the ways to choose the second pair. Since one rank has already been chosen, there are \\(12 \\times \\binom{4}{2}\\) ways to do this. Finally, we choose the remaining card. There are \\(11 \\times \\binom{4}{1} = 44\\) ways to do this. Your friend calculates the probability as \\[ \\frac{13 \\times \\binom{4}{2} \\times 12 \\times \\binom{4}{2} \\times 44}{\\binom{52}{5}} \\approx .095, \\] but then finds online that the actual probability of “two pair” is only \\(.0475\\).

So the conditional probability above is \\[ P(\\text{both boys}\\ |\\ \\text{at least one boy}) = \\frac{P(\\text{both boys} \\text{ and } \\text{at least one boy})}{P(\\text{at least one boy})} = \\frac{P(\\text{both boys})}{P(\\text{at least one boy})} = \\frac{1/4}{3/4} = \\frac{1}{3}. \\] In the above example, the joint probability \\(P(\\text{both boys} \\text{ and } \\text{at least one boy})\\) is easy to calculate because the two events are redundant. If we know that both are boys, then we automatically know that at least one is a boy. The information that at least one of her children attends St. Joseph’s (and, thus, is a boy) increases the probability that she has two boys from \\(1/4\\) to \\(1/3\\). Examples You and your friend Amy are each dealt two cards: hers face up and yours face down. In which of the following scenarios are you more likely to have a pair: when she has a pair of queens when she has a queen and a 5? Dr. No has captured James Bond and forces him to play a game of Russian roulette. (Note: Russian roulette is very different from the casino game roulette!) Dr. No shows him an revolver with 6 empty chambers and places 2 bullets into adjacent chambers. He makes Bond spin the cylinder, place the muzzle against his head, and pull the trigger. He survives! Luckily for Bond, the cylinder stopped on one of the empty chambers. Now Dr. No gives Bond two options: he can re-spin the cylinder before firing again or he can fire with the gun in its current state. (Keep in mind that the cylinder rotates to the next chamber each time the gun is fired.) What option should Bond choose to maximize his chance of surviving? Clearly write out the conditional probability of interest using \\(P(B|A)\\) notation. Find the probability. (Hint: You should not need to do any calculations. You should be able to find the probability just by thinking carefully about the information you have. Make sure you explain your reasoning carefully.) Additional Exercises "],
["independence.html", "Lesson 7 Independence Motivating Example Theory Examples Additional Exercises", " Lesson 7 Independence Motivating Example Many gamblers believe that after a string of losses, they are “due” for a win. Consider a gambler who repeatedly bets on reds in roulette, an event with probability \\(18 / 38 \\approx 0.474\\). The ball has not landed in a red pocket on any of the last 4 spins of the wheel. Does this make it more likely that he will win on the next spin? This is really a conditional probability question in disguise. We want to know the probability that the ball will land in a red pocket on the 5th spin, given that it did not land in a red pocket on any of the first 4 spins: \\[ P(\\text{red on 5th spin}\\ |\\ \\text{not red on first 4 spins}). \\] Theory To verify that the two probabilities are exactly the same, we do the calculation: \\[\\begin{align*} P(\\text{red on 5th spin}\\ |\\ \\text{not red on first 4 spins}) &amp;= \\frac{P(\\text{not red on first 4 spins}\\ \\cap\\ \\text{red on 5th spin}) }{P(\\text{not red on first 4 spins})} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{ 20^4 \\cdot 18 \\big/ 38^5 }{20^4 \\big/ 38^4} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{18}{38}. \\end{align*}\\] We see that the conditional probability is \\(18 / 38\\), which is the same as the probability that the 5th spin is red if we did not know the outcome of the first 4 spins. In mathematical notation, \\[\\begin{align*} P(\\text{red on 5th spin}\\ |\\ \\text{not red on first 4 spins}) &amp;= P(\\text{red on 5th spin}) \\end{align*}\\] When conditioning on one event (e.g., “not red on first 4 spins”) does not change the probability of another event (e.g., “red on 5th spin”), we say that the two events are independent. In this case, whether the gambler wins on the 5th spin is independent of the fact that he has lost each of the last 4 spins. The folk belief that one is “due” for a win after a series of losses is plain wrong and is known as the gambler’s fallacy. Definition 7.1 Two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are said to be independent if the \\[\\begin{equation} P(B | A) = P(B). \\tag{7.1} \\end{equation}\\] Theorem 7.1 Two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent if and only if their probabilities multiply: \\[\\begin{equation} P(A \\cap B) = P(A) P(B). \\tag{7.2} \\end{equation}\\] Proof. First, we assume (7.1) and show that (7.2) holds: \\[\\begin{align*} P(A \\cap B) &amp;= P(A) P(B | A) &amp; \\text{by the Multiplication Rule} \\\\ &amp;= P(A) P(B) &amp; \\text{by assumption}. \\end{align*}\\] Conversely, we assume (7.2) and show that (7.1) holds: \\[\\begin{align*} P(B | A) &amp;= \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)} &amp; \\text{by the definition of conditional probability} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{P(A) P(B)}{P(A)} &amp; \\text{by assumption} \\\\ &amp;= P(B). \\end{align*}\\] Examples One card is dealt off the top of a well-shuffled deck of cards. Is the event that the card is a heart independent of the event that the card is an ace? Two cards are dealt off the top of a well-shuffled deck of cards. Is the event that the first card is a heart independent of the event that the second card is a heart? In the dice game Yahtzee, five dice are rolled. The outcomes of the five dice are independent. What is the probability of rolling a “Yahtzee” (i.e., when all five dice show the same number)? Additional Exercises "]

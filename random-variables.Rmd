# Random Variables {#rv}

## Motivating Example {-}

Texas hold 'em is a popular variant of poker. In Texas hold'em, each 
player starts with 2 cards (called "hole cards") that are only known to them. 
In addition, there are 5 cards in the center (called "community cards") that
are shared by all the players. The player that wins is the one with the 
best five-card poker hand among the 7 cards (i.e., the 2 hole cards unique to them, 
plus the 5 community cards). 

Alice and Bob are playing Texas hold'em using a single deck of cards. The 
5 community cards have not been revealed yet. 

Alice is looking at her 2 hole cards, which are

```{r alice, echo=FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "20%", fig.align = "default"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hayeah/playing-cards-assets/master/png/queen_of_diamonds.png") 
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hayeah/playing-cards-assets/master/png/3_of_diamonds.png")
```

Because she already has two diamonds, she wonders how many more diamonds 
there are in the community cards. If there are 3 or more, then she has a flush.

Bob, on the other hand, has the following hole cards 

```{r bob, echo=FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "20%", fig.align = "default"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hayeah/playing-cards-assets/master/png/jack_of_clubs.png") 
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hayeah/playing-cards-assets/master/png/jack_of_hearts.png")
```

Because he has two jacks of different suits, he is less interested 
in the suit than in the number of jacks among the community cards. If there are 2, 
then he has a four-of-a-kind. If there are 0, then he just has a lowly 
pair.

Both Alice and Bob are interested in the same random phenomenon: 
the 5 community cards with their 
$\binom{48}{5} \approx 1,712,304$ possible outcomes. 
However, their attention is drawn to different quantities:

- Alice to the _number of diamonds_
- Bob to the _number of jacks_

The _number of diamonds_ and the _number of jacks_ are two examples of **random variables** associated 
with this phenomenon. A random variable is simply a way of assigning a number to every 
possible outcome in a probability experiment. As we have seen, 
depending on the quantity of interest, there may be many random variables associated with the same 
probability experiment.

To appreciate that Alice and Bob are interested in different random variables, suppose the 
5 community cards are revealed to be

```{r community, echo=FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "20%", fig.align = "default"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hayeah/playing-cards-assets/master/png/4_of_hearts.png")
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hayeah/playing-cards-assets/master/png/jack_of_diamonds.png")
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hayeah/playing-cards-assets/master/png/4_of_clubs.png")
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hayeah/playing-cards-assets/master/png/ace_of_spades.png")
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hayeah/playing-cards-assets/master/png/8_of_diamonds.png")
```

Alice's random variable (the _number of diamonds_) is 2, 
while Bob's (the _number of jacks_) is 1. To help them decide how much to bet, 
Alice and Bob need to know the _probabilities_, such as

- the probability that the number of diamonds is at least 3.
- the probability that the number of jacks equals 2.

<!-- We can simulate the values that a random variable will take. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # define a standard deck of cards (A=1, J=11, Q=12, K=13) -->
<!-- cards <- data.frame( -->
<!--   rank=rep(1:13, 4), -->
<!--   suit=rep(c("C", "D", "H", "S"), each=13) -->
<!-- ) -->

<!-- # remove the 4 cards that Alice and Bob already have -->
<!-- remaining_cards <- cards[-c(11, 16, 25, 37), ] -->

<!-- # initialize vectors for storing the numbers of diamonds -->
<!-- numbers_of_diamonds <- c() -->

<!-- # repeat 10000 times -->
<!-- for (i in 1:10000) { -->
<!--   # simulate 5 community cards -->
<!--   samp <- sample(nrow(remaining_cards), size=5, replace=FALSE) -->
<!--   comm <- remaining_cards[samp, ] -->

<!--   # count up how many diamonds there are, add to the vector -->
<!--   numbers_of_diamonds <- c(numbers_of_diamonds, sum(comm$suit == "D")) -->
<!-- } -->

<!-- # tabulate the simulations -->
<!-- table(numbers_of_diamonds) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Probabilities such as these are how we ultimately describe random variables. -->


## Theory {-}

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eOkqx5aa3Kc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

We describe random variables (such as the number of diamonds or the number of jacks) by the 
probabilities of their possible values. This is summarized by a function called the 
**probability mass function**.

```{definition pmf-function, name="Probability Mass Function"}
The **probability mass function** (p.m.f.) of a random variable $X$ is a function that 
specifies the probability of different outcomes:
\[ f(x) = P(X = x). \]
```

```{example, name="Calculating the P.M.F."}
Let's calculate the p.m.f. of the number of diamonds, $X$, among the community cards. We deal 
5 cards from a deck of cards that has had 4 cards removed (because they have already been 
dealt to Alice and Bob). Furthermore, we know that 2 of these cards were diamonds.
So the deck has 48 cards left, of which 11 are diamonds.

First, we calculate $f(0)$, the probability that $X = 0$. In order for there to be no 
diamonds, all 5 cards must be selected from the $48 - 11 = 37$ non-diamonds. So the probabiilty is 
\[ f(0) = P(X = 0) = \frac{\binom{37}{5}}{\binom{48}{5}} = .2546. \]

Next, we calculate $f(1)$, the probability that $X = 1$. We can choose any one of the 11 diamonds 
and pair it with any of the $\binom{37}{4}$ ways to choose 4 cards from the non-diamonds.
\[ f(1) = P(X = 1) = \frac{11 \cdot \binom{37}{4}}{\binom{48}{5}} = .4243. \]

Now, we calculate $f(2)$, the probability that $X = 2$. We can match any one of the 
$\binom{11}{2}$ ways to choose 2 diamonds with the $\binom{37}{3}$ ways to choose 
3 non-diamonds:
\[ f(2) = P(X = 2) = \frac{\binom{11}{2} \cdot \binom{37}{3}}{\binom{48}{5}} = .2496. \]

Continuing in this way, we can calculate $f(3)$, $f(4)$, and $f(5)$. (Try these yourself!)

When the random variable only takes on a handful of possible values, we can write out 
the probabilities in a table.

|       | 0  | 1  | 2  |  3 | 4  | 5  |
|------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|$f(x)$ | .2546 | .4243 | .2496 | .0642 | .0071 | .0002

For random variables that take on many possible values, it is usually more convenient 
to specify the p.m.f. as a formula. In this example, the formula below produces the 
same probabilities as the table above, when you plug in the right value of $x$:
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= \frac{\binom{11}{x} \binom{37}{5-x}}{\binom{48}{5}} & x &= 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 
\end{align*}
Try plugging different values of $x$ into this formula and verifying that you get 
the probabilities in the table above.
```

```{example, name="Using the P.M.F."}
In order for Alice to have a flush, there must be at least 3 diamonds among the community cards. 
Let's see how she can easily calculate this probability, once she has the p.m.f. $f(x)$.

In terms of the random variable $X$, the probability that there are at least 3 diamonds is 
$P(X \geq 3)$, which is 
\begin{align*} 
P(X \geq 3) &= f(3) + f(4) + f(5) \\
&= .0642 + .0071 + .0002 \\
&= .0715.
\end{align*}

The complement rule (\@ref(thm:complement)) can sometimes save time. Although it would not helped in this example, 
we could have also calculated the probability as follows:
\begin{align*}
P(X \geq 3) &= 1 - P(X < 3) \\
&= 1 - (f(0) + f(1) + f(2)) \\
&= 1 - (.2546 + .4243 + .2496) \\
&= .0715.
\end{align*}
```

```{example, name="Graphing the P.M.F."}
A graph of the p.m.f. can quickly reveal which values of a random 
variable are more or less likely. 
On the graph below, the $x$-axis represents the 
possible values of the random variable. Each impulse represents the 
probability of a possible value.
```

```{r pmf-graph, echo=FALSE, fig.show = "hold", fig.align = "default"}
plot(0:5, dhyper(0:5, 11, 37, 5), pch=19, xlab="x", ylab="f(x)")
for(x in 0:5) {
  lines(c(x, x), c(0, dhyper(x, 11, 37, 5)), lwd=2)
}
```

From the graph, it is immediately clear that 1 diamond is most probable. 
Unfortunately for Alice, it does not seem promising that she will get the 
3 or more diamonds she needs to secure a flush.



## Examples {-}

1. Continuing with the example from the lesson, let $Y$ be the number of Jacks in the community cards. Calculate and graph the p.m.f. of $Y$.

2. Two fair, six-sided dice are rolled.

    a. Let $S$ be the sum of the two numbers. Calculate and graph the p.m.f. of $S$.
    b. Let $D$ be the absolute difference between the two numbers. 
    (That is, $D$ is always a positive number.) Calculate and graph the p.m.f. of $D$.

3. A fair coin is tossed 5 times. Let $Z$ be the number of heads. Calculate and graph the p.m.f. of $Z$. 
Use the p.m.f. to calculate the probability of getting at least 2 heads.

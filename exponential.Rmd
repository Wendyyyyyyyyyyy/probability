# Exponential Distribution {#exponential}

## Motivation {-}

The exponential distribution is commonly used to model time: the time between arrivals, 
the time until a component fails. We have already encountered several examples of exponential 
random variables---the time of the first arrival in a Poisson process follows an 
exponential distribution.

## Theory {-}

```{definition exponential, name="Exponential Distribution"}
A random variable $X$ is said to follow a $\text{Exponential}(\lambda)$ distribution if 
its p.d.f. is 
\begin{equation}
f(x) = \begin{cases} \lambda e^{-\lambda x} & x \geq 0 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases},
(\#eq:exponential-pdf)
\end{equation}
or equivalently, if its c.d.f. is 
\begin{equation}
F(x) = \begin{cases} 1 - e^{-\lambda x} & x \geq 0 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}. 
(\#eq:exponential-cdf)
\end{equation}
```
The p.d.f. and c.d.f., for three different values of $\lambda$, are graphed below.

```{r expo-graph, echo=FALSE, fig.show = "hold", fig.align = "center",fig.cap="PDF and CDF of the Exponential Distribution", fig.asp=1.2}

       c(expression(paste(lambda, " = 0.5")), expression(paste(lambda, " = 1.0")), expression(paste(lambda, " = 1.5"))),
       lwd=3, col=c("blue", "red", "orange"))

plot(t, 1 - exp(-0.5 * t), type="l", lwd=3, col="blue",
     xaxt="n", yaxt="n", bty="n",
     xlab="x", ylab="Cumulative Distribution Function F(x)", 
     xlim=c(-0.5, 5.5), ylim=c(-0.05, 1.05))
lines(t, 1 - exp(-t), type="l", lwd=3, col="red")
lines(t, 1 - exp(-1.5 * t), type="l", lwd=3, col="orange")
axis(1, pos=0)
axis(2, pos=0)
lines(c(-0.5, 0), c(0, 0), lwd=3, col="blue")
lines(c(-0.5, 0), c(0, 0), lwd=2, col="red")
lines(c(-0.5, 0), c(0, 0), lwd=1, col="orange")
legend(4, 0.5, 
       c(expression(paste(lambda, " = 0.5")), expression(paste(lambda, " = 1.0")), expression(paste(lambda, " = 1.5"))),
       lwd=3, col=c("blue", "red", "orange"))
```

First, we show that the first arrival time in a Poisson process follows an 
exponential distribution. These calculations are essentially the same as the ones 
we did in Lesson \@ref(continuous).
```{theorem first-arrival, name="First Arrival Time in a Poisson Process"}
The time of the first arrival in a Poisson process of rate $\lambda$ is an 
$\text{Exponential}(\lambda)$ random variable. 
```

```{proof}
Let $T$ be the time of the first arrival. Then, for $t > 0$, the c.d.f. of $T$ is 
\begin{align*}
F(t) &= P(T \leq t) \\
&= 1 - P(T > t) \\
&= 1 - P(\text{0 arrivals in $[0, t]$}) \\
&= 1 - e^{- \lambda t} \frac{(\lambda t)^0}{0!} \\
&= 1 - e^{-\lambda t}.
\end{align*}
This is the c.d.f. of an $\text{Exponential}(\lambda)$ random variable, as we derived above.
```

```{theorem interarrival, name="Interarrival Times in a Poisson Process"}
The times between arrivals (called **interarrival times**) in a Poisson process of rate $\lambda$ 
are independent $\text{Exponential}(\lambda)$ random variables. 
```


```{example, name="Lifetime of a Lightbulb"}

```

```{theorem memoryless, name="Memoryless Property of the Exponential Distribution"}
\[ P(X > s + t | X > s) = P(X > t) \]
```

```{example, name="Memorylessness and the Poisson Process"}

```


## Essential Practice {-}

1. Let $X$ denote the distance (in meters) that an animal moves from its birth site to the first 
territorial vacancy it encounters. Suppose that for banner-tailed kangaroo rats, $X$ has an exponential
distribution with parameter $\lambda = .01386$ (as suggested in the article "Competition and Dispersal
from Multiple Nests," Ecology, 1997: 873â€“883).

    What is the probability that the distance is...

    a. at most 100 m? 
    b. at most 200 m? 
    c. between 100 and 200 m?

2. Small aircraft arrive at San Luis Obispo airport according to a Poisson process at a rate of 6 per hour. What is the probability that more than 15 minutes elapse between when the second and third 
planes land?

3. A post office has 2 clerks. Alice enters the post office while 2 other customers, Bob
and Claire, are being served by the 2 clerks. She is next in line. Assume that the time
a clerk spends serving a customer (in minutes) follows an $\text{Exponential}(\lambda=0.2)$ 
distribution. What is the probability that Alice is the last of the 3 customers to be done being
served? (Hint: This can be answered without any calculations, by thinking about 
the memoryless property.)

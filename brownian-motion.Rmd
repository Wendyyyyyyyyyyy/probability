The videos above discussed Brownian motion of particles moving in two or three dimensions; for simplicity, we 
will only consider Brownian motion in one dimension. This can be used to model, among other things, a particle 
moving along a line.

Shown below are three sample paths of Brownian motion.

TODO

```{definition bm, name="Brownian Motion"}
**Brownian motion of scale $\alpha$** $\{ B(t); t \geq 0 \}$ is a continuous-time process with the 
following properties:

1. The "particle" starts at the origin at $t=0$: $B(0) = 0$.
2. The displacement over any interval $(s, t)$, denoted by $B(t) - B(s)$, follows a 
$\text{Normal}(\mu=0, \sigma=\sqrt{\alpha(t - s)})$ distribution.
3. **Independent increments:** The displacements over non-overlapping intervals are independent.
```

These three properties allow us to calculate most probabilities of interest.

```{example, name="Grain of Pollen"}
The horizontal position of a grain of pollen suspended in water can be modeled by Brownian motion 
with parameter $\alpha = 4$ mm/s. 

a. What is the probability the pollen grain moves by more than 10 mm (in the horizontal direction) 
between 1 and 4 seconds?
b. If the particle is more than 5 mm away from the origin after 1 second, what is the probability the pollen grain 
moves by more than 10 mm between 1 and 4 seconds?
```

```{solution}
.

a. The displacement of the particle between 1 and 4 seconds is represented by $B(4) - B(1)$, which 
we know follows a $\text{Normal}(\mu=0, \sigma=\underbrace{\sqrt{4(4-1)}}_{\sqrt{12}})$ distribution. 

Since the question does not indicate whether the displacement is positive or negative, we’re really interested in determining P(|B(4) - B(1)| > 10). Because the distribution of
$B(4) - B(1)$ is symmetric about $0$, this is the same as $2 P(B(4) - B(1) > 10)$. 
\begin{align*}
P(|B(4) - B(1)| > 10) &= 2 P(B(4) - B(1) > 10) \\
&= 2 P(\underbrace{\frac{B(4) - B(1) - 0}{\sqrt{12}}}_Z > \frac{10 - 0}{\sqrt{12}}) \\
&= 2 (1 - \Phi(\frac{10}{\sqrt{12}})) \\
&\approx .0039.
\end{align*}
b. The interval $(0, 1)$ does not overlap with the interval $(1, 4)$. Therefore, by the independent 
increments property, $B(1) = B(1) - B(0)$ is independent of $B(4) - B(1)$, and 
\[ P(|B(4) - B(1)| > 10 \big| |B(1)| > 5) = P(|B(4) - B(1)| > 10) = .0039. \]
```

### Brownian Motion as the Limit of a Random Walk {-}

Brownian motion is the extension of a (discrete-time) random walk $\{ X[n]; n \geq 0 \}$ 
to a continuous-time process $\{ B(t); t \geq 0 \}$. The recipe is as follows:

1. Suppose the steps of the random walk happens at intervals of $\Delta t$ seconds. That is, 
\[ X(t) = X\left[\frac{t}{\Delta t}\right] \]
2. We let $\Delta t \to 0$. Since the steps happen so rapidly, it does not make sense to take steps of 
the same size. We should also rescale the size of the steps to be commensurate with how quickly they 
are happening. The right rescaling is:
\[ B(t) = \sqrt{\Delta t} X(t). \]

If we start with a discrete-time random walk and rescale time and steps in this way, we get 
Brownian motion. The animation below illustrates this.

## Essential Practice {-}

1. Brownian motion is used in finance to model short-term asset price fluctuation. Suppose the price (in dollars) of a barrel of crude oil varies according to a Brownian motion process; specifically, suppose the change in a barrel’s price 
$t$ days from now is modeled by Brownian motion $B(t)$ with $\alpha = .15$.

    a. Find the probability that the price of a barrel of crude oil has changed by more than $1, in either direction, after 5 days.
    b. Repeat (a) for a time interval of 10 days.
    c. Given that the price has increased by $1 after one week (7 days), what is the probability that the price has increased by at least $2 after two weeks (14 days)?
